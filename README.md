Putting into practice what I've learnt from training

So far I've set the foundation to be able to build an app that acts as the guide book for the board game 221B Baker Street. User would input a number and the case, solution & hint is shown to the user.

To add to this application:
 - [ ] nested view (step 16) for the panel content
 - [ ] incorporate dialogs instead of using the Message Toast maybe...
